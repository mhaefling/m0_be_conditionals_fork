# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    - To make a choice of what your program should do based on the results of input or values.

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    - Not forget that = is to assign a value and that == is the correct comparison

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    - Just thinking about how the if / elsif / else options should be structured when trying to determine results of comparisons.  Its challenging to think of all the possible situations you might have that you need to account for in your logic.
